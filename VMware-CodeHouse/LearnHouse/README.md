Applications of Machine Learning Algorithms

Description
===========
This tutorial is a learning guide for a naive seeker to dive into Machine Learning. It explains the foundations of Machine Learning and its applications. The tutorial covers the basics of the most widely used Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning Algorithms. Starting from the naive Linear Regression it covers upto Random Forests and SVM. The tutorial is a stepwise guide to apply these algorithms to real life problems such as sentiment analysis, predictions and classifications.
